DomeCalc

This is what I use to generate the config file for the processing app.

The coordinates and identifiers for each dome bar are found in data/bars.csv

I originally sized everything at 1200x1200, but now am adjusting everything 
down by a factor of 2.6666667 so that it works out to 450x450.
